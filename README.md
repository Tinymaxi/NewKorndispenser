# NewKorndispenser

This is the code for an apparatus that is able to dispense corn out of bags to a given amount.  
It runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico using the official Pico SDK and supports modules such as:

- HX711 load cell amplifier (for weighing)
- Rotary encoder with button (for menu navigation)
- LCD over I²C (for display)
- NeoPixel ring (for feedback/indicators)
- Buzzer/vibrator (for alerts)

The goal is to accurately measure and dispense a configurable quantity of corn.
